# Essentials
A plugin providing administrative commands for Frostspark.

Essentials also doubles as a "best practices" plugin for Frostspark, showing an example of how commands are intended to be created, and how changes to the server API will impact plugins.

This plugin currently targets the vanilla Terraria [Frostspark](https://github.com/Frostspark) implementation due to excessive use of native Terraria engine calls.  
Over time, feasibility of targeting just the [API](https://github.com/Frostspark/FrostsparkAPI) will be measured and if possible - the plugin will target just the API.

The plugin also currently targets the command management binary that's private right now. Once this is resolved, it will become compilable. The repository therefore acts more as a proof of concept than a usable resource until then.
